# holberton-simple_shell
The objective of this project is for us to create a simple shell.

For this project we will only have to create a simple Unix shell where we can run some of the most known commands. For this part of the project, no advanced functions, pipes or redirection will be asked, but we can add them if we like.

# Instructions
<ul> You must program a mini Unix shell, try to focus on something simple like BusyBox. </ul>
<ul> This interpreter must display at least a simple $ and wait until you type a command line which will be validated by pressing enter. </ul>
<ul> The $ will be shown again only once the command has been completely executed. </ul>
<ul> The command lines are simple, you will not have pipes, redirection or any other advanced functions. </ul>
<ul> You must manage the errors, by displaying a message adapted to the error output.</ul>

This project will help you better understand
<ul> Shell</ul>
<ul>Operating systems services</ul>
<ul>Command-line interfaces</ul>
<ul>Unix system</ul>
<ul>Process creation and synchronization</ul>
<ul>Commands syntax</ul>
<ul>Scripting language</ul>
